       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
              <li>1 small sweet watermelon (a 6 pounder will do)</li>
              <li>    1 small lime, juiced (optional)</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Instructions</h2>
       <ol>
        <li> Slice the watermelon in half. Using a big spoon, scoop chunks of sweet watermelon into the blender. Discard the rind.</li>
        <li> Blend the watermelon until it is totally pulverized. This shouldnâ€™t take more than a minute. For extra flavor, squeeze the juice of one small lime into the blender and blend for a few seconds.</li>
        <li> If your watermelon is notably pulpy or seeded, pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a pitcher. If not, you can pour it directly into glasses filled with ice. Watermelon juice will keep in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days. The juice will separate over time; stir it with a spoon to recombine.</li>
       </ol>
